            Buddhism is a religion/dharma based on the teachings of Siddhartha Guatama, or the 'Buddha'.
            Buddhism originated in India and quickly spread throughout much of Asia, primarily China.
            The religion teaches various traditions, beliefs, and practices pertaining to self-realization and attuning to the will of the universe.
            Some major beliefs of Buddhists are the Four Noble Truths, which essentially reaffirms the notion that life is perpetually unsatisfying.
            The Eightfold Path is a set of edicts that help an individual achieve freedom from the cycle of existential suffering, known as Nirvana.
            Buddhism teaches that in an interconnected world, all actions have consequences (karma).
            The consequences of acts undertaken in this and earlier lifetimes will be felt in a next one, in a process known as reincarnation.
            It is a Buddhist aim to educate oneself and meditate in order to escape from this cycle of rebirth, to enter Nirvana.

            The first Noble Truth is that life is suffering.
            Life as we normally live it is full of pleasures and pains; pleasures do not represent lasting happiness.
            They are inevitably tied in with suffering since we suffer from wanting them, wanting them to continue, and wanting pain to go so pleasure can come.
            The second Noble Truth is that suffering is caused by craving for pleasures and for things to be as they are not.
            We refuse to accept life as it is.
            The third Noble Truth, however, states that suffering has an end, and the fourth offers the means to that end: the Eight Fold Path and the Middle Way.
            If one follows this combined path he or she will attain Nirvana, an indescribable state of all-knowing lucid awareness in which there is only peace and joy.
            The Eight Fold Path includes Right Views (the Four Noble Truths), Right Intention, Right Speech, Right Action, Right Livelihood/Occupation, Right Endeavor, Right Mindfulness, and Right Concentration (meditation).
            The Eight Fold Path is followed by the principle of the Middle Way, which characterizes the Buddha's life.
            The Middle Way represents a rejection of all extremes of life.
            Rather than either severe pains of the body or a life of excessive pleasures, the Buddha advised a moderate or balanced lifestyle and the cultivation of mental and emotional composure through meditation and morality.

            <h2>FAQs</h2>
            Question: Do Buddists pray?<br>
            Answer: Buddhists don't pray to a Creator God, but they do have devotional meditation practices which could be compared to praying. Radiating loving-kindness to all living beings is a practice which is believed to benefit those beings. The sharing of merit is a practice where one dedicates the goodness of one's life to the benefit of all living beings as well as praying for a particular person. In Tibet, prayer is going on most of the time. Buddhists Tibetans pray in a special way. They believe that when certain sounds and words, mantras, are said many times, they arouse good vibrations within the person. If a mantra is repeated often enough, it can open up the mind to a consciousness which is beyond words and thoughts.
            In Japan, millions of Buddhists pray to Amida Buddha, the Buddha of Infinite Light. They believe that Amida has created a Pure Land in the west and that those who have faith and repeat Amida's name in prayer will go there. Yet they also believe that Amida is really within them.
