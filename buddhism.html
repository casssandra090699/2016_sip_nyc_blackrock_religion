            <p class="parag1">Buddhism is a religion/dharma based on the teachings of Siddhartha Guatama, or Buddha. 
            The religion teaches various traditions, beliefs, and practices pertaining to self-realization and attuning to the will of the universe. 
            Buddhism originated in India and quickly spread throughout much of Asia, primarily China. 
            Some major beliefs of Buddhists are the Four Noble Truths, which essentially reaffirms the notion that life is perpetually unsatisfying and should be appreciated in its essence, and the Eightfold Path, a set of edicts that help an individual achieve freedom from the cycle of existential suffering, known as Nirvana.
