    <p class="parag">Hello, we are the creators of this website. We hope are enjoying learning more about religion. We created this site as a challenge from the way religion is taught in schools. It's often inaccurate and doesn't always explain the true purpose of religion. With this website, we offer a different way to learn more about religions and to learn the truth behind the misconceptions. </p>
