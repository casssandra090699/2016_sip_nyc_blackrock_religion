        Similar beliefs to Judaism - coming of Messiah
        Appeal to poor people
        Jesus of Nazareth was born Jewish - he preached in Israel: a moral code of love, charity, and humility
        Put to death in AD 30: he was seen as an agitator to rich people and to the government
        Resurrected on the 3rd day
        This made him known as the Son of God: belief helped spread religion throughout the Roman Empire and in Jewish communities in the Middle East
        By 4th century AD 10% of Roman Empire was a convert
        Slave, dispossessed farmers, and impoverished city dwellers found hope in this religion
        Different denominations include Catholic Christians, Methodists, Presbyterian, Southern Baptists, and Lutheran
        The Ten Commandments are the obligations Christians must fulfill in order to get into heaven and receive eternal life
        Prayer is the act of communicating with God

         <p class="parag1">Christianity emerged during the Roman Empire in the 1st century C.E. 
         The basic principles of Christianity are based on the life and teachings of Jesus. 
         Jesus was a Jewish prophet who preached in Israel about purifying Judaism in order to estable the kingdom of God on earth. 
         Christianity is comprised of many branches and subcategories. 
         The three most notable branches are Roman Catholicism, Eastern Orthodoxy, and Protestantism.
         Currently, Christianity is the most practiced religion worldwide with more than 2.18 billion Christians worldwide.
